## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

- How to combine flexbox with relative and absolute positionings.
- How to align custom list styles with their corresponding texts.

### Continued development

- At the moment the main area that I would like to focus on would be writing organized and DRY CSS code. (Just like last time!).

### Useful Resources

- Stack Overflow
- W3Schools
- MDN Webdocs
